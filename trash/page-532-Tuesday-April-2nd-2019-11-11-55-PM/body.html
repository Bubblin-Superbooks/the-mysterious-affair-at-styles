<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was intended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs. Inglethorp&rsquo;s bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening Mademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs. Inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely shut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all probability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her hurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp forgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from home, so that the last&mdash;and fatal&mdash;dose was actually taken twenty-four hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing to that delay that the final proof&mdash;the last link of the chain&mdash;is now in my hands.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
