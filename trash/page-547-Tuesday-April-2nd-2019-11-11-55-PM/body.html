<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred Inglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him in any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which, after all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John Cavendish.</p><p>&ldquo;But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine that night. The broken bell, Cynthia&rsquo;s absence&mdash;arranged by Inglethorp through his wife&mdash;all these are wasted. And then&mdash;he makes his slip.</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice, who, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It is probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected. Caught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his desk.</p></div> </div>
