<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Dear me, Poirot,&rdquo; I said with a sigh, &ldquo;I think you have explained everything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his wife are reconciled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;thanks to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still loved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love with him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a misunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a sensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she did not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are both unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart.</p></div> </div>
