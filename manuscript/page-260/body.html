Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked sharply. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think your pretty explanations influence me in the slightest. I&rsquo;ll admit that it wasn&rsquo;t he who bought strychnine at the chemist&rsquo;s shop. What of that? I dare say he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is arsenic&mdash;not strychnine,&rdquo; said Poirot mildly.</p><p>&ldquo;What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way just as well as strychnine. If I&rsquo;m convinced he did it, it doesn&rsquo;t matter a jot to me <em>how</em> he did it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. <em>If</em> you are convinced he did it,&rdquo; said Poirot quietly. &ldquo;I will put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of hearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
