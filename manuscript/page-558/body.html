<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I confessed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on the 7th&mdash;the day after Miss Howard&rsquo;s departure? The &lsquo;1&rsquo; was written in before the &lsquo;7&rsquo; to turn it into the &lsquo;17th&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the letter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at once a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
