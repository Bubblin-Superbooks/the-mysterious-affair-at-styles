Haven&rsquo;t I always told you he would murder her in her bed? Haven&rsquo;t I always hated him like poison?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Poirot. &ldquo;That bears out my little idea entirely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What little idea?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day of my friend&rsquo;s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a sentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember affirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had been murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it nonsense?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
