<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the little station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It was a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat Essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great war was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed into another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, that&rsquo;s just what I want.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
