At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses&mdash;as is probable&mdash;I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the case against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; said Japp heartily. &ldquo;And, on behalf of the Yard, I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, though I&rsquo;m bound to confess I can&rsquo;t at present see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always were a marvel! So long, then, moosier.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
