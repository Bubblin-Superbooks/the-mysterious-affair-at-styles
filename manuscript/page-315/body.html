I don&rsquo;t know, because I never saw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was some tragedy connected with her death&mdash;she took an overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was broken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service. Everywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had been nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life&mdash;I loved it.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed living in the memory of those old glad days.</p></div> </div>
