<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My dear Evelyn,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Cavendish, &ldquo;this can&rsquo;t be true!&rdquo;</p><p>Miss Howard nodded grimly.</p><p>&ldquo;True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won&rsquo;t forget or forgive in a hurry. Don&rsquo;t mind if they&rsquo;ve only sunk in a bit. Probably water off a duck&rsquo;s back, though. I said right out: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re an old woman, Emily, and there&rsquo;s no fool like an old fool. The man&rsquo;s twenty years younger than you, and don&rsquo;t you fool yourself as to what he married you for. Money! Well, don&rsquo;t let him have too much of it. Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much time he spends over there.&rsquo; She was very angry. Natural! I went on, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you. He&rsquo;s a bad lot.</p></div> </div>
