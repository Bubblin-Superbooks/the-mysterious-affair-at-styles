I do hope she&rsquo;s found him out at last!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was Dorcas there, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not. She &lsquo;happened to be near the door&rsquo;. It was a real old bust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought of Mrs. Raikes&rsquo;s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard&rsquo;s warnings, but wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every possible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, &ldquo;Aunt Emily will send him away, and will never speak to him again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
