<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not pleased with me, mon ami?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear Poirot,&rdquo; I said coldly, &ldquo;it is not for me to dictate to you. You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A most admirable sentiment,&rdquo; remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his feet. &ldquo;Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the smaller desk in the corner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Inglethorp&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; He tried the roll top tentatively. &ldquo;Locked. But perhaps one of Mrs. Inglethorp&rsquo;s keys would open it.&rdquo; He tried several, twisting and turning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation of satisfaction. &ldquo;Voil√†! It is not the key, but it will open it at a pinch.</p></div> </div>
