<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On Monday, therefore, at six o&rsquo;clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss Howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs. Raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six o&rsquo;clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the chemist&rsquo;s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and writes the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John&rsquo;s handwriting, which she had previously studied carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes him an anonymous note&mdash;still copying his hand-writing&mdash;which takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him.</p></div> </div>
