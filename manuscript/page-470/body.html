<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Alfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison. He also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses testified to the accuracy of these statements.</p><p>The gardeners&rsquo; evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken, and then Dorcas was called.</p><p>Dorcas, faithful to her &ldquo;young gentlemen,&rdquo; denied strenuously that it could have been John&rsquo;s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the teeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the boudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the face of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her gallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to deny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to give evidence against her husband.</p></div> </div>
