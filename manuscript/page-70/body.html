He has been a most famous detective.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to let me call him in&mdash;to investigate this matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&mdash;now? Before the post-mortem?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, time is an advantage if&mdash;if&mdash;there has been foul play.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; cried Lawrence angrily. &ldquo;In my opinion the whole thing is a mare&rsquo;s nest of Bauerstein&rsquo;s! Wilkins hadn&rsquo;t an idea of such a thing, until Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists, Bauerstein&rsquo;s got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of course he sees them everywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>I confess that I was surprised by Lawrence&rsquo;s attitude. He was so seldom vehement about anything.</p></div> </div>
