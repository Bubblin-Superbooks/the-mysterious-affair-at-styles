<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp and clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. &lsquo;You have lied to me, and deceived me,&rsquo; she said. I didn&rsquo;t hear what Mr. Inglethorp replied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did&mdash;but she answered: &lsquo;How dare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe everything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace upon our name!&rsquo; Again I didn&rsquo;t hear what he said, but she went on: &lsquo;Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty clearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.&rsquo; Then I thought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
