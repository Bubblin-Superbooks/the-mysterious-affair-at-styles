<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My hostess turned to me.</p><p>&ldquo;John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have given up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member&rsquo;s wife&mdash;she was the late Lord Abbotsbury&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;does the same. She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a war household; nothing is wasted here&mdash;every scrap of waste paper, even, is saved and sent away in sacks.&rdquo;</p><p>I expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different wings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out over the park.</p></div> </div>
