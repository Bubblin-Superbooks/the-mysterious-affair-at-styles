He was waiting for the Scotland Yard men.</p><p>In a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and accosted the shorter of the two.</p><p>&ldquo;I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, if it isn&rsquo;t Mr. Poirot!&rdquo; cried the Inspector. He turned to the other man. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and I worked together&mdash;the Abercrombie forgery case&mdash;you remember, he was run down in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you remember &lsquo;Baron&rsquo; Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in Antwerp&mdash;thanks to Mr. Poirot here.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
