It is by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.&rdquo; Then, as I looked at him inquiringly: &ldquo;Yes, my friend, she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are refugees from their native land.

He was hardly more than five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of his attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound.</p></div> </div>
