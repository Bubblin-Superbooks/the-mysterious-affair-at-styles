<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Now, Poirot,&rdquo; I remarked resignedly, &ldquo;perhaps you will tell me what all this is about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, mon ami, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you realize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is greatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have cleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs. Cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr. Inglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of that at the inquest&mdash;but now it has a very different significance.</p></div> </div>
