<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to the park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I, accordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me. It was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain his absence?</p><p>He accosted me eagerly.</p><p>&ldquo;My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Denby kept me late last night. It was one o&rsquo;clock before we&rsquo;d finished. Then I found that I&rsquo;d forgotten the latch-key after all. I didn&rsquo;t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you hear the news?&rdquo; I asked.</p></div> </div>
