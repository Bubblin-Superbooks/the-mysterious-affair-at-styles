He also took long walks into the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his confidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was driving at.</p><p>It occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes&rsquo;s farm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on Wednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet him. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to the farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at me cunningly.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m from the Hall, bain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked this way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies from the village?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
