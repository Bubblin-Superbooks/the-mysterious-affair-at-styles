The fact is, we&rsquo;ve treated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I don&rsquo;t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there&rsquo;s a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when one doesn&rsquo;t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole thing&rsquo;s damned awkward! And I&rsquo;m thankful he&rsquo;s had the tact to take himself off. It&rsquo;s a good thing Styles wasn&rsquo;t the mater&rsquo;s to leave to him.</p></div> </div>
