I could hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one, doubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I stepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost immediately. I drew him aside.</p><p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is this wise? Surely you don&rsquo;t want the whole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into the criminal&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think so, Hastings?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
