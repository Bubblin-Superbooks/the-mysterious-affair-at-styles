I suppose you can give me no idea to whom these letters were addressed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I couldn&rsquo;t, sir. I was out in the evening.

That&rsquo;s what happens when I&rsquo;m not here to look after things.&rdquo;</p><p>Poirot lifted his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray you. I should like to examine them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
