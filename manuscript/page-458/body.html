My old friend John!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Every murderer is probably somebody&rsquo;s old friend,&rdquo; observed Poirot philosophically. &ldquo;You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must say I think you might have given me a hint.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps, mon ami, I did not do so, just because he was your old friend.&rdquo;</p><p>I was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed on to John what I believed to be Poirot&rsquo;s views concerning Bauerstein. He, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him. Nevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings were pretty well clipped for the future.</p></div> </div>
