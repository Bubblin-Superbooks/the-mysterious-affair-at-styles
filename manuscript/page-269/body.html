<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot&rsquo;s message to Lawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a grudge against my friend&rsquo;s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the croquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about, with a still more ancient mallet.</p><p>It struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message. Otherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I did not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by Lawrence&rsquo;s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my part, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you,&rdquo; I remarked untruthfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. The truth is, I&rsquo;ve got a message for you&mdash;from Poirot.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
