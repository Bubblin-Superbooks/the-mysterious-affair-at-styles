I, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist&rsquo;s shop, and purchased strychnine at six o&rsquo;clock on Monday last was not Mr. Inglethorp, for at six o&rsquo;clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting Mrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either at six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs. Raikes&rsquo;s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the village. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!&rdquo;</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
