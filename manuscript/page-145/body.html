Have they taken him to prison yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Taken who to prison?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother died from heart seizure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More fool, Lawrence!&rdquo; retorted Miss Howard. &ldquo;Of course Alfred Inglethorp murdered poor Emily&mdash;as I always told you he would.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear Evie, don&rsquo;t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is better to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn&rsquo;t until Friday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not until fiddlesticks!&rdquo; The snort Miss Howard gave was truly magnificent. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all off your heads. The man will be out of the country by then. If he&rsquo;s any sense, he won&rsquo;t stay here tamely and wait to be hanged.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
