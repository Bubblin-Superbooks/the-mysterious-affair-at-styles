<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">just as I have to mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A most admirable sentiment,&rdquo; remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his feet. &ldquo;Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the smaller desk in the corner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Inglethorp&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; He tried the roll top tentatively. &ldquo;Locked. But perhaps one of Mrs. Inglethorp&rsquo;s keys would open it.&rdquo; He tried several, twisting and turning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation of satisfaction. &ldquo;<em>Voil√†!</em> It is not the key, but it will open it at a pinch.&rdquo; He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly filed papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking approvingly as he relocked the desk: &ldquo;Decidedly, he is a man of method, this Mr. Inglethorp!&rdquo;</p><p>A &ldquo;man of method&rdquo; was, in Poirot&rsquo;s estimation, the highest praise that could be bestowed on any individual.</p></div> </div>
