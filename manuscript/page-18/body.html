She was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feet to match&mdash;these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation, I soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.</p><p>&ldquo;Weeds grow like house afire. Can&rsquo;t keep even with &rsquo;em. Shall press you in. Better be careful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,&rdquo; I responded.</p></div> </div>
