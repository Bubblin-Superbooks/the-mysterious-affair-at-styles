My wife works regularly &lsquo;on the land&rsquo;. She is up at five every morning to milk, and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It&rsquo;s a jolly good life taking it all round&mdash;if it weren&rsquo;t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!&rdquo; He checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. &ldquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;ve time to pick up Cynthia.
