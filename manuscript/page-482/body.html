<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of a hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter underclothing. Yes, or no?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might have been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite unaware of their presence?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should not think it likely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it is possible?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
