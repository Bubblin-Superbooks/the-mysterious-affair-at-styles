Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took the tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress&rsquo;s room I saw it at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and asked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was out, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt had only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took it in.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
