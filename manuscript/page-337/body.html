He&rsquo;s welcome to her money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to keep up the place all right?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father&rsquo;s money goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the present, so there is his share as well.
