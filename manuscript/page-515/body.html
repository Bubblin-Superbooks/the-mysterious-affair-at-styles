<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I myself, in company with the police, went to the deceased&rsquo;s room, and whilst there I, apparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found that, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all. This confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of the tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her own room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased&rsquo;s room when the alarm was given.&rdquo;</p><p>I shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her mother-in-law&rsquo;s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and has not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized with an alarming paroxysm.</p></div> </div>
