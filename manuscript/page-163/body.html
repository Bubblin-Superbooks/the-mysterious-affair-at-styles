<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit.</p><p>&ldquo;I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they <em>had</em> been planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly both of the gardeners&mdash;for there were two sets of footprints in the bed&mdash;had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window, and they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite convinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two gardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right in my supposition.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was very ingenious,&rdquo; I could not help admitting. &ldquo;I must confess that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite erroneous.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
