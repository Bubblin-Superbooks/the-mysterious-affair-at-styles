It must have been made just at the time they were engaged. It came quite as a surprise to Wells&mdash;and to John Cavendish also. It was written on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the servants&mdash;not Dorcas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He says not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One might take that with a grain of salt,&rdquo; I remarked sceptically. &ldquo;All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon?&rdquo;</p><p>Poirot smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>Mon ami</em>, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
