<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;When did you first suspect John Cavendish?&rdquo; I asked, after a minute or two.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you not suspect him at all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not Alfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife&mdash;and you remember, he strenuously denied it at the inquest&mdash;it must be either Lawrence or John. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish&rsquo;s conduct was just as inexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing was explained quite naturally.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
