<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mr. Hastings&mdash;you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>It struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming girl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I suppose she forgot, or didn&rsquo;t think she was likely to die&mdash;anyway, I am <em>not</em> provided for! And I don&rsquo;t know what to do. Do you think I ought to go away from here at once?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good heavens, no! They don&rsquo;t want to part with you, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p>Cynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands. Then she said: &ldquo;Mrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
