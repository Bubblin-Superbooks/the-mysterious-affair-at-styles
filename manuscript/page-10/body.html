<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who had married John&rsquo;s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic, autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable fortune of her own.</p><p>Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish early in their married life. He had been completely under his wife&rsquo;s ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons.</p></div> </div>
