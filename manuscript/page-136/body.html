<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What time did you go out last evening?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About six o&rsquo;clock, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.&rdquo; He rose and strolled to the window. &ldquo;I have been admiring these flower beds. How many gardeners are employed here, by the way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as a gentleman&rsquo;s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir. A fair sight it was. But now there&rsquo;s only old Manning, and young William, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like. Ah, these are dreadful times!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
