Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way just as well as strychnine. If I&rsquo;m convinced he did it, it doesn&rsquo;t matter a jot to me how he did it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. If you are convinced he did it,&rdquo; said Poirot quietly. &ldquo;I will put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of hearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Miss Howard. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I always told you the man is a villain? Haven&rsquo;t I always told you he would murder her in her bed? Haven&rsquo;t I always hated him like poison?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
