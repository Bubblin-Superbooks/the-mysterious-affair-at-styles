At five o&rsquo;clock, Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of tea&mdash;nothing to eat&mdash;to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful&mdash;so white and upset. &lsquo;Dorcas,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had a great shock.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for that, m&rsquo;m,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea, m&rsquo;m.&rsquo; She had something in her hand. I don&rsquo;t know if it was a letter, or just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept staring at it, almost as if she couldn&rsquo;t believe what was written there.</p></div> </div>
