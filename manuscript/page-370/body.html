Evidently there was a likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.</p><p>When we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary&rsquo;s offer of tea.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.&rdquo;</p><p>I followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out a small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table, and, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!</p><p>My jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:</p><p>&ldquo;No, <em>mon ami</em>, I am not in my second childhood!
