Strychnine Hydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you manage to take this photograph?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dropped my hat from the balcony,&rdquo; explained Poirot simply. &ldquo;Visitors were not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many apologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia&rsquo;s colleague had to go down and fetch it for me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
