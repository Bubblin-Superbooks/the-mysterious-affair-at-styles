Lady Tadminster&rsquo;s sister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror&mdash;one of our oldest families.&rdquo;</p><p>Mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr. Bauerstein.</p><p>We had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested that we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our way, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary.
