<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia appeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white overall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow dispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily addressed as &ldquo;Nibs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a lot of bottles!&rdquo; I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the small room. &ldquo;Do you really know what&rsquo;s in them all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say something original,&rdquo; groaned Cynthia. &ldquo;Every single person who comes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on the first individual who does not say: &lsquo;What a lot of bottles!&rsquo; And I know the next thing you&rsquo;re going to say is: &lsquo;How many people have you poisoned?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
