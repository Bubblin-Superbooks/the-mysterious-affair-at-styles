It was in my mind when I asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were the bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male impersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us.

It was because, whilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your shoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia&rsquo;s room was unbolted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But he declared that he saw it bolted!&rdquo; I cried.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Poirot dryly. &ldquo;And that was just what confirmed my suspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
