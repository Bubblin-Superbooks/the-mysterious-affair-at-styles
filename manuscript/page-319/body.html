Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener had told John.&rdquo;</p><p>Her face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she care, or did she not?</p><p>She moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.</p><p>&ldquo;These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind moving&mdash;thank you, Mr. Hastings.&rdquo; And she walked quietly past me out of the window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.</p></div> </div>
