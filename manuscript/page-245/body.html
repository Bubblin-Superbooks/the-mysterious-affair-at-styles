<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I entered Mrs. Inglethorp&rsquo;s room. She was at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out: &lsquo;Alfred&mdash;Alfred&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp&rsquo;s after-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It is retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to have been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the coffee after dinner about eight o&rsquo;clock, whereas the symptoms did not manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the face of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the evening.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
