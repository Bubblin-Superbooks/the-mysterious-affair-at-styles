I don&rsquo;t say she wasn&rsquo;t surrounded by sharks&mdash;she was. But it was only her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along comes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp&mdash;and within two months&mdash;hey presto!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me, Miss Howard,&rdquo; said Poirot very earnestly, &ldquo;if Mr. Inglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will hang him as high as Haman!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.</p><p>&ldquo;But I must ask you to trust me.
