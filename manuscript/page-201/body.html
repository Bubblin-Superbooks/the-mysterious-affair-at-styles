The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was staggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on his face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of Alfred Inglethorp&rsquo;s guilt?</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Inglethorp,&rdquo; said the Coroner, &ldquo;you have heard your wife&rsquo;s dying words repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly I can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein is much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim light, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
