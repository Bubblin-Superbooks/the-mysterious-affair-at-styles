But I don&rsquo;t know that I ought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Dorcas hesitated.</p><p>Poirot looked at her keenly.</p><p>&ldquo;My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying your mistress&rsquo;s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary that we should know all&mdash;if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her back to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the murderer to justice.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
