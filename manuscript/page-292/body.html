<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses,&rdquo; I quoted.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or Lawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Of course an actor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>But Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.</p><p>&ldquo;And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they are both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain initial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all that is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his eyes&mdash;those are the salient points about his personal appearance.</p></div> </div>
