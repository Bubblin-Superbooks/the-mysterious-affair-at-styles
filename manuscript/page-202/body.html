<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Miss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her voice.</p><p>&ldquo;If you mean that I was fond of her&mdash;yes, I was. You know, Emily was a selfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always wanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for them&mdash;and, that way she missed love. Don&rsquo;t think she ever realized it, though, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different footing. I took my stand from the first. &lsquo;So many pounds a year I&rsquo;m worth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides&mdash;not a pair of gloves, nor a theatre ticket.&rsquo; She didn&rsquo;t understand&mdash;was very offended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn&rsquo;t that&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the whole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of her.</p></div> </div>
