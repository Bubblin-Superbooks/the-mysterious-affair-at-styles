<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You find it so?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Good Lord, yes! There&rsquo;s this terrible business to start with. Scotland Yard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know where they won&rsquo;t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in the country&mdash;damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing. Pretty thick, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cheer up, John!&rdquo; I said soothingly. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t last for ever.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
