<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Dr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.</p><p>&ldquo;What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell you the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison, but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is absurd.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently taken an overdose?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs. Inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a time, as she dealt with Coot&rsquo;s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
