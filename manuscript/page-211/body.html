<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">very just&mdash;the word of a Belgian policeman, whose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be arrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See, then, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, in about half an hour. We&rsquo;re seeing the Coroner and the doctor first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Call for me in passing&mdash;the last house in the village. I will go with you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses&mdash;as is probable&mdash;I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the case against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; said Japp heartily. &ldquo;And, on behalf of the Yard, I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, though I&rsquo;m bound to confess I can&rsquo;t at present see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always were a marvel! So long, then, moosier.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
